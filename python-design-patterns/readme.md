## Design patterns

A Design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Creational Object Creation ( factory pattern, singleton pattern, builder pattern, prototype pattern )
Structural Object Composition
Behavioral Object Interaction

### SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle : A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
Open/Closed Principle : You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.
Liskov Substitution Principle : Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
Interface Segregation Principle : Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
Dependency Inversion Principle : Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
